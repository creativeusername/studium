cpio -- copy files to and from archives (and directories)

mode 1: Copy-out mode (copy into archive)
mode 2: Copy-in mode (copy from archive)
mode 3: Copy-pass mode (mixed, copy-in & copy-out)

-i: extract. run in copy-in mode.
-v: verbose mode. shows process information.
-t: list. prints a table of contents of the input.

The command cpio -ivt uses the copy-in mode. So it copies files out
of an giving archive, shows extra information about the process, and
writes it's content in a table.
